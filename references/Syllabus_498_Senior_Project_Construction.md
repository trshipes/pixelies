## Course, Department, and University Policies

### Academic Integrity and the Honor Code

All students are expected to adhere to Charleston Southern University’s [Code of Academic Honesty](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/Policy-R-58-updated-Feb-2023.pdf). For example, all work must be original and must not be copied from another student. Failure to follow this guideline will be considered a violation of the code and will be treated accordingly. Students are encouraged to ask their instructor(s) for clarification regarding their academic dishonesty standards.

### Course Evaluations

To pursue our mission of *Academic Excellence in a Christian Environment*, we must receive feedback from students. The student-feedback survey is online and will be available to students in the second half of the semester. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the short evaluation survey, which is anonymous. Your professor will let you know when the survey is available. The survey will be available through your MyCSU account. We greatly value your opinion!

### Student Representatives

These are students who are designated by letter to represent the University on official business (e.g., athletic, music, and similar events). If officially scheduled absences cause these students to miss tests, assignments, and/or other similar academic activities, University policy allows these to be made up without penalty. Following this policy, Student Representatives may opt to either make-up tests *before* departure or supplanting missed tests with the final exam grade. Final exams must always be taken *before* departure to avoid an Incomplete for the course. Scheduled assignments remain subject to the lateness policy and must be turned in before departure to avoid lateness penalties. Student Representatives are responsible to inform the instructor of official absences and to make all appropriate arrangements.
